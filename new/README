Architecture Suggestion For MapProxy

Goals:
 1. Not to hard to migrate too. MapProxy has a good working architecture that works quite well.
 2. Make understanding the code easier.
 3. Better reflect configuration in code. Configuration is very clear and understandable in it's types and functions.
    Code is not.
 4. Even if full concept could be ambitioned, try to implement parts of it.
